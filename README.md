# looping-calc

Brief:

Looping calculator writes a program in Python which performs the calculations detailed below. However, only the arithmetic operation of “+” is used. The substraction operator "-" is technically used but only to negate values. 

The program first enters into a main menu, giving the user a choice of entering the number "1" , "2", "3", or “4” . Entering the character "q" exits the program.

If at any point in the program, the user enters invalid input, then the program allows the user to enter the input again.





If the user enters "1" at the main menu:

The user is prompted to enter two numbers, and the summation (addition) of the two numbers is then printed to screen.





If the user enters "2" at the main menu:

The user is prompted to enter two positive numbers x and y, and the product of the two numbers is then printed to screen. 






If the user enters "3" at the main menu:

The user is prompted to enter two positive numbers, x and y. The value of x to the power of y is printed to screen.






If the user enters “4” at the main menu:

The user is prompted to enter two positive numbers, x and y. The modulus of x divided by y is then printed to screen.
